# The Road to Therapy by Yellow Bricks

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project based on [Diginext Starter](https://github.com/digitopvn/nextjs-bun-starter)

This project was born at the [Unicorns in Tech Hackathon 2024](https://www.unicornsintech.com/uithack24/) and is a platform to help people find the right therapist for them.

# Development

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
# or
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
