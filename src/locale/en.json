                Two copies of the consultation report are required for the cost reimbursement procedure: Four copies of the report are used as follows:
                * one copy remains with the doctor who prepared the report for documentation purposes
                * one copy is sent to the health insurance company. The diagnosis and contents of the report are blacked out.
                * one copy is sent to an expert commissioned by the health insurance company. Personal data such as name is blacked out for anonymization.
                * a copy is sent to the doctor who finally carries out the treatment."

It supports patients with statutory health insurance in obtaining psychotherapeutic care (psychotherapeutic consultations, acute treatment and trial treatment).
                The TSS is sometimes extremely busy and long telephone waiting times of up to 2 hours can be expected. Unfortunately, the TSS staff usually only speak German, so English-speaking people should at best ask a German-speaking friend for help, or alternatively use [this link](link to our guide)."
